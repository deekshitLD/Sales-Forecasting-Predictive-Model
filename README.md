# Sales Forecasting Predictive Model
This code provides an example of building a predictive model to forecast sales using a time series approach. It utilizes the random forest regressor algorithm to predict sales based on time-based features such as month, day, and year.

# Data
The code assumes the availability of a CSV file named sales_data.csv containing the sales data. The data should have two columns: date and sales. The date column should be in a date format, and the sales column should represent the corresponding sales values.

# Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve converting the date column to the datetime format and extracting time-based features such as month, day, and year. These features will be used as input for training the predictive model.

# Model Training
The code splits the preprocessed data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library. It then trains a random forest regressor model using the RandomForestRegressor class, specifying the number of estimators (trees) to use.

# Model Evaluation
The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the model's performance. The MSE metric quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual sales values.

# Usage
Prepare the sales data in a CSV file named sales_data.csv with columns date and sales.

Ensure that the necessary dependencies, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, are installed.

Adjust any desired parameters, such as the number of estimators in the random forest regressor.

Run the code.

The model will be trained and evaluated, and the mean squared error will be displayed.
